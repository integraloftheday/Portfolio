### Abstract
Touch plays an important role in increasing immersion in virtual reality experiences. We imagine a device that can provide a variety of physical interactions with shapes, textures, and other haptic affordances in a way that is modularly extendable. A multipurpose device like this works towards a sustainable design and use ecosystem. We envision a wrist-worn device with multiple actuated pneumatic haptic proxies that opens up new opportunities of haptic explorations. We present work which allows users to feel virtual objects of varying shapes and textures. The users will also be able to physically feel interactions with these virtual objects when picked up or thrown.
