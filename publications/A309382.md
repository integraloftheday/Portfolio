### A309382
Successive squares visited by a knight without the (-2,-1) and (-2,1) moves on a spirally numbered board moving to the lowest available unvisited square at each step. 

#### Sequence 
``` text/2-3
1, 10, 3, 8, 5, 2, 13, 28, 25, 50, 27, 12, 9, 4, 7, 18, 15, 6, 17, 34, 59, 
14, 11, 24, 49, 52, 29, 32, 55, 58, 89, 54, 31, 88, 53, 26, 79, 120, 83, 
122, 173, 126, 87, 56, 91, 130, 177, 232, 295, 228, 225, 290, 227, 172, 125, 
82, 51, 80, 121, 124, 85, 128, 175...
```

### Comments 

Board is numbered with the following square spiral:
```text/2-3

  17--16--15--14--13
   |               |
  18   5---4---3  12   .
   |   |       |   |
  19   6   1---2  11   .
   |   |           |
  20   7---8---9--10   .
   |
  21--22--23--24--25--26

```

Move clarification: starting at 1 the knight can move to 16, 14, 12, 10, 24, and 22 but not 18 or 20.

The sequence is finite: at step 90, square 30 is visited after which there are no free squares to move to and the sequence ends.
