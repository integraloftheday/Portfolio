### Overview
Pulsar was created as an entry into the [2021 Sunhacks Hackathon](https://sunhacks2021.devpost.com/). I worked with a stellar team, Alex Vuong, Ashley Hummel, and Teresa Tran. [pulsar](https://sunhacks-pulsar.glitch.me/) is a VR visualizer built using web technologies. We connect a pulse monitor to your finger, which sends your heart rate into the cloud to be captured by our website. View one of five scenes designed to adapt to your heartbeat and relax as you experience a sense of serenity and awe.

### Role
I worked on the physical electronics. Programming the data collection and relay cloud server. I programmed some of the VR scenes. 

### Technologies Used
Pulsar was built completely around webVR which allows its use on any headset. By doing so the virtual reality experiences are available at the Pulsar website, [https://sunhacks-pulsar.glitch.me/](https://sunhacks-pulsar.glitch.me/).  In addition to the software pulsare utilized an ESP32 powered heart rate monitor to dynamically update the VR experiences.
