### Overviewcd 
In Fall 2021, as part of AME 494, Designing for Dreamscape, my peers and I created a virtual reality experience utilizing *[Dreamscape Immersive](https://www.dreamscapeimmersive.com/)* VR technology. The narrative focussed on what the future could become without action against climate change. 

### Role
I was one of the developers and I focussed on backend development. This included interfacing with the *Dreamscape* SDK to create: haptic sensations (floors rumbling, and fans blowing) and story and experience triggers. Additionally, I implemented a multiplayer data transfer servers allowing individuals to pass data (images) across different narrative timelines. 

### Technologies Used
The experience was programmed in the Unity Game engine, which interfaced with the *Dreamscape Immersive* SDK and virtual reality Pod. The Pod is a full room with full bodying and props tracking, floor hapitcs, and wind haptics.
