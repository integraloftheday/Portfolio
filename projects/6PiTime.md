### Overview
This website finds the time in the digits of pi. It was created to celebrate pi-day and all the mathematics of pi it self. The website uses the idea in practice any random string of digits can be found in pi to find the current time in the digits of pi. This idea is based on the [mypiday](https://www.mypiday.com/) website by Wolfram.
