### Overview
A web-based numerical solver for the 1D time independent Schrödinger Equation. The website can be found here: [integraloftheday.github.io/WaveFunctionSolver/index.html](https://integraloftheday.github.io/WaveFunctionSolver/index.html). It was created as the final project for PHY241 and was inspired by the the Science Fair Project: [*Exact, Numerical, and Machine Learning Approaches to Solving the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation Utilizing Runge Kutta 4th order, and MNIST Network*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVVni2sjKJkxG7dv88nmfnkax8K4br2X/view?usp=sharing)

### Documentation 
All the documentation can be found here: [integraloftheday.github.io/WaveFunctionSolver/about.html](https://integraloftheday.github.io/WaveFunctionSolver/about.html)
The documentation also includes a write up on how the nummerical solver was derived and implemented.
