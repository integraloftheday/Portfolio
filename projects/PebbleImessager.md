### Overview
Your favorite Imessager client on your discontinued smart watch. 

Since the takeover by Fitbit pebble smartwatches could no longer send messages on iPhones. However, using this watch app and server applications users can once again send iMessageâ€™s from iPhones. To accomplish this the application uses a server running on a Mac (or emulated Mac) to send messages.

### Technologies Used
Pebble Js and Python Flask were used to create both the watch app and the supporting iMac server.
